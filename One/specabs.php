    <td class="q">Flurry of Strikes</td>
    <td class="a">When using the weapon of their Combat Path, a Samurai may attack with a flurry of strikes at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, he may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a –2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of strikes Attack Bonus column on Table above: Samurai. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the Samurai might make before his next action. When a Samurai reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to –1, and at 10th level it disappears. A Samurai must use a full attack action to attack with a flurry of strikes. When using flurry of strikes, a Samurai may attack only with the weapon specific to their Combat Path. When using weapons as part of a flurry of strikes, a Samurai applies his Strength bonus (not Str bonus ×1-1/2 or × 1/2) to his damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether he wields a weapon in one or both hands. The Samurai can’t use any weapon other than their Combat Path as part of a flurry of strikes. When a Samurai reaches 15th level, his flurry of strikes ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack he gets from flurry of strikes, he gets a second extra attack at his full base attack bonus. If a Samurai has the Walker of Many Paths feat (See below) he can not switch weapons during Flurry of Strikes.

If a spell or effect that would normally cause a Samurai to flee they instead stand in their current location but may take no actions other than to defend themselves. At 9th level the Samurais focus improves enough that they may take a single attack actions, but not a full attack or any other action. At 13th level he is allowed to make a full attack but not use Flurry of Strikes or take any other action. Finally at 17th level a Samurai is allowed to Use their Flurry of Strikes.</td>
