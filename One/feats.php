    <td class="a"><b>Prerequisite</b>
<br/>Base attack bonus +1.
<br/><br/>
<b>Benefit</b>
<br/>You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.
<br/><br/>
A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).
<br/><br/>
<b>Normal</b>
<br/>Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.
<br/><br/>
<b>Special</b>
<br/>A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.

    <td class="q">Power Attack</td>
    <td class="a"><b>Prerequisite</b>
<br/>Str 13
<br/><br/>
<b>Benefit</b>
<br/>On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.
<br/><br/>
<b>Special</b>
<br/>If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can’t add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)

<br/>Str 13, Power Attack
<br/><br/>
<b>Benefit</b>
<br/>If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.
